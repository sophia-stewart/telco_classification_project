    "My top performing model has an accuracy of approximately 79% when predicting customer churn. It is obvious that monthly charges are a factor in customer churn, but there are also many other factors in play, only some of which I was able to touch on in this report. \n",

    "I recommend offering a discount program for longtime customers so they will not be driven away by the increasing prices the longer they remain a customer.\n",
